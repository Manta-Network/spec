\MantaPay{} aims to solve the long-standing privacy problems facing cryptocurrencies. At its heart, it uses various cryptographic constructions including NIZK (non-interactive zero knowledge proof) systems to ensure user privacy from \emph{first principles} and to build the foundational layer for programmable private money. The \MantaPay{} protocol provides the following features:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Elastic Multi-Asset Shielded Pool: A shielded pool for every kind of asset with elastic annonymity set resizing
    \item Verifiable Viewing Keys: Opt-in transaction transparency with audit correctness assurance
    \item Programmable \zkAsset{s}: New Transparent \UTXO{} model allowing programmability layers to be built on top of the shielded pool
    \item Delegated Proof Generation: Decoupling the spending access from the proof generation access gives hardware wallets native support for \zkAsset{s}
\end{enumerate}
